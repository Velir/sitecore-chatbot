# Sitecore ChatOps
For the Sitecore Hackathon 2017 we created a ChatBot designed to help Sitecore development and operations teams monitor and interact with their Sitecore Environments.  The goal was to develop our MVC (Minimum Viable ChatBot) to demonstrate a number of interesting concepts.

A natural language interface to help remove the barrier of remembering very specific syntax
The ability to query your Azure Application Insights data warehouse to understand the current state of your Sitecore environment, both logs and performance metrics.

The ability to interact directly with your Sitecore instances running on Azure Application Services
This concept of ChatOps, or conversational driven operations has been used very successfully by leading technology organizations like Github and Atlassian.  We feel this proof of concept demonstrates some interesting possibilities on how to make Sitecore technical teams more effective.
